# SAT_solver
💻This project implements three algorithms to determine the satisfiability of clauses: Resolution, DP (Davis-Putnam), and DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland). These algorithms analyze randomly generated clauses to determine if they are satisfiable (SAT).  

📄 Files Overview
- resolution.py: Selects the best algorithm (Resolution, DP, or DPLL) to determine the SAT of the randomly generated clauses.

- Memory fix.py: Generates a set randomly and outputs a .csv file with the cpu, memory usage and the time it took to solve.

- The folder SATLIB contains files from SATLIB that were ran using CNF read.py. It outputs a .csv file as well with all the .cnf files ran. 

- Code with comparison working.py: Compares the results obtained by each algorithm, providing details about the algorithm used, the result achieved, and the time taken.  

- Draft Files: These files are drafts and do not work.
