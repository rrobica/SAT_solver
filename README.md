# SAT_solver
This project is an impementation of the three algorithms that uses clauses and determine their satisfiability: Resolution, DP and DPLL. There are three type of algorithms implemented.  

The file named "resolution.py" chooses the best algorithm (Resolution, DP or DPLL) to determine SAT of the randomly generated clauses.  

The file named "Code with comparison working.py" works and compares the results giving you details about the algoritm used, the result it got, and the time needed.  

The other files are drafts and they don't work.  

Thanks for help (https://github.com/CsizmaAle).
